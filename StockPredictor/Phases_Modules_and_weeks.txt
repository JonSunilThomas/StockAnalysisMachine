Phase 1: Foundation & Data Pipelines (Weeks 1-5)

The goal of this phase is to build a rock-solid, automated data collection and processing system. This is the most important part of the entire project.

Week 1: Module 1.1 - Fundamental Data API Integration

    Goal: Connect to a financial data provider and pull raw financial statements.

    Tasks:

        Sign up for an API key from a provider like Alpha Vantage or IEX Cloud.

        Write Python scripts with functions like get_income_statement(ticker), get_balance_sheet(ticker), etc.

        Handle API rate limits and error checking gracefully.

        Test the scripts on a list of 10-20 tickers from the NIFTY 50 or S&P 500.

    Documentation: Create a README.md file in your project folder explaining how to set up the API key and run the scripts. Document each function with clear docstrings.

    Outcome: A set of Python scripts that can reliably fetch fundamental data for any given stock ticker.

Week 2: Module 1.2 & 1.3 - Database Setup & Fundamental Feature Engineering

    Goal: Store the raw data and calculate key financial ratios.

    Tasks:

        Set up a simple database (PostgreSQL is recommended, but SQLite works too).

        Define the table schemas for your financial statements (e.g., an income_statements table).

        Modify your Week 1 scripts to save the pulled data into your database.

        Write a new script that reads the raw data from the database, calculates features (P/E, D/E, ROE, etc.), and saves them to a new fundamental_features table.

    Documentation: Create a diagram of your database schema. Document the formula for each engineered feature in your code and project README.

    Outcome: An organized database that automatically stores raw data and calculated fundamental features.

Week 3: Module 1.4 & 1.5 - Technical Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering

    Goal: Fetch historical price data and calculate a suite of technical indicators.

    Tasks:

        Write scripts to pull daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for your tickers and store it in the database.

        Use a library like pandas_ta or TA-Lib to calculate at least 10-15 technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.).

        Store these calculated indicators in a technical_features table, linked by date and ticker.

    Documentation: List all the technical indicators you are using and briefly explain what they measure. Document the data pipeline.

    Outcome: A database populated with daily price history and a rich set of technical features for each stock.

Week 4: Module 1.6 & 1.7 - Macro & News Pipelines

    Goal: Incorporate external context from the economy and news media.

    Tasks:

        Use the fredapi Python wrapper to pull key macroeconomic data (e.g., interest rates, inflation) and store it.

        Use a service like NewsAPI.org to write a script that fetches recent news articles related to your target tickers.

        Store the headline, source, and full text of the articles in a news_articles table in your database.

    Documentation: Document the sources and names of the macro indicators. Detail the news fetching process.

    Outcome: Your database is now enriched with macroeconomic trends and a stream of real-time news.

Week 5: Module 1.8 - NLP Preprocessing & Sentiment Scoring

    Goal: Convert unstructured news text into a quantifiable sentiment score.

    Tasks:

        Set up a Python environment with NLP libraries like Hugging Face Transformers.

        Load a pre-trained FinBERT model.

        Write a script that reads articles from your news_articles table, runs them through FinBERT to get a sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral), and saves this score into a new sentiment_features table.

    Documentation: Explain the choice of the FinBERT model and how to interpret the sentiment scores.

    Outcome: A powerful, automated pipeline that turns qualitative news into a quantitative feature.

Phase 2: Individual Model Development (Weeks 6-8)

Now that we have the fuel (data), we can start building the engine components.

Week 6: Module 2.1 - Baseline Fundamental Model (XGBoost)

    Goal: Build a simple model using only fundamental data to see how well it performs.

    Tasks:

        Load your fundamental_features data.

        Define a target variable (e.g., "will the stock price be 10% higher in 3 months?").

        Train an XGBoost classification model.

        Evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy and precision. Don't aim for perfection; this is a baseline.

    Documentation: Document your model's parameters, feature importance, and performance metrics.

    Outcome: Your first predictive model and a performance benchmark to beat.

Week 7: Module 2.2 - Baseline Technical Model (LSTM)

    Goal: Build a time-series model using only technical data.

    Tasks:

        Load your OHLCV and technical_features data.

        Structure the data into sequences suitable for an LSTM (e.g., use the last 30 days of data to predict the next day).

        Build and train a simple LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

        Evaluate its performance. This is often a difficult task, so focus on the process.

    Documentation: Document the LSTM architecture (layers, neurons) and the data structuring process.

    Outcome: A functioning time-series model that learns from price action.

Week 8: Module 2.3 - Data Unification for Synthesis

    Goal: Create a single, unified dataset to feed into our final "meta-model."

    Tasks:

        This is a critical data engineering task. Write a script that combines your daily technical features, daily sentiment scores, and quarterly fundamental features onto a single daily timeline.

        You will need to "forward-fill" the quarterly data (e.g., the P/E ratio for Q1 remains the same every day until the Q2 data is released).

        Create one master final_features table or data frame.

    Documentation: Create a data flow diagram showing how all feature tables are merged into the final master table. Explain the logic for forward-filling.

    Outcome: A single, clean, perfectly aligned dataset ready for the master model.

Phase 3: Synthesis, Validation & Interpretation (Weeks 9-11)

Let's combine our experts and rigorously test their collective wisdom.

Week 9: Module 3.1 - Ensemble "Meta-Model" Training

    Goal: Build the master model that learns from all features simultaneously.

    Tasks:

        Load the master dataset from Module 2.3.

        Train a powerful XGBoost model on this unified dataset. This model will learn the complex interactions between fundamentals, technicals, and sentiment.

        Perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best settings for the model.

    Documentation: Document the final model's parameters, and most importantly, run a feature importance analysis to see what the model considers most predictive.

    Outcome: The core "brain" of your AI analyst.

Week 10: Module 3.2 - Backtesting Framework Construction

    Goal: Simulate how your model would have performed historically.

    Tasks:

        Write a Python script that steps through historical data.

        At each step, it uses your trained model to make a decision (buy, sell, hold).

        The script then simulates executing that trade and tracks a portfolio's value over time.

        Calculate key performance metrics: Cumulative Return, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown.

    Documentation: Thoroughly document the backtesting logic, including assumptions about transaction costs and slippage.

    Outcome: A clear, unbiased report on your strategy's historical performance. This is your moment of truth.

Week 11: Module 3.3 - Explainable AI (XAI) Integration

    Goal: Make your "black box" model transparent.

    Tasks:

        Integrate the SHAP library with your trained meta-model from Module 3.1.

        Write a function that, for any given prediction, can generate a SHAP plot or a list of factors that contributed positively or negatively to the decision.

    Documentation: Include examples of SHAP outputs in your project README and explain how to interpret them.

    Outcome: A trustworthy model that can explain the "why" behind its predictions.

Phase 4: User Interface and Automation (Weeks 12-14)

The final stretch: making your system usable and autonomous.

Week 12: Module 4.1 - Interactive Dashboard (UI/API)

    Goal: Create a simple interface to interact with your AI analyst.

    Tasks:

        Use a simple web framework like Streamlit or Flask.

        Build a user interface with an input box for a stock ticker.

        When a ticker is entered, your app should call the model, get the prediction and the SHAP explanation, and display it all in a clean, organized dashboard.

    Documentation: Document how to launch and use the dashboard application.

    Outcome: A tangible, interactive product that showcases your entire project.

Week 13: Module 4.2 - Pipeline Orchestration & Automation

    Goal: Make the entire data-to-prediction pipeline run automatically on a schedule.

    Tasks:

        Refactor your data-pulling and model-training scripts to be easily executable.

        Use a scheduling tool. You can start with simple cron jobs on a server or use a more robust tool like Apache Airflow.

        Set up a daily schedule to fetch new data and a weekly schedule to retrain the model.

    Documentation: Create a detailed guide on the automated pipeline, its schedule, and how to monitor it for errors.

    Outcome: A living, breathing AI analyst that stays up-to-date without manual intervention.

Week 14: Final Review, Refactoring & Project Showcase

    Goal: Clean up your code, finalize all documentation, and prepare a presentation of your project.

    Tasks:

        Review all your code for clarity, efficiency, and bugs.

        Read through all your documentation one last time to ensure it's complete and understandable.

        Prepare a short presentation or a detailed blog post that walks through your journey, your architecture, and your backtesting results.

    Outcome: A polished, well-documented, and impressive portfolio project.
